[**Astro**](https://astro.build/) is a framework for building blazingly fast statically generated sites. It is a great choice when building content-driven websites (this site is built with Astro!). But, when it comes to searching your site, there aren't many great picks except for [**Pagefind**](https://pagefind.app/), a full-text search library written in Rust which helps it reach outstanding performance.

Pagefind is really easy to integrate with *any* framework, because the only requirement is, well, static site generation! Just run the following command in your terminal (assuming that your generated site files reside in `./dist`):

```bash showLineNumbers=false
yarn dlx pagefind --site dist
```

The above command will generate a `pagefind` directory in our `dist` folder. This directory contains everything related to Pagefind: binaries (WASM), scripts (JS), indexes. It also contains Pagefind's modular UI library (`pagefind-modular-ui.js`), but we won't need that today. Only 2 files out of this whole directory are actually in our field of interest: `pagefind.js` and `pagefind-highlight.js`. The first one is the primary Pagefind library, which we'll need to implement searching, and the last one is the highlighting library used by Pagefind. For highlighting, skip to [**Highlighting**](#highlighting).

## Search UI

Now that we know the basics, it's time to create the search UI!

### Our stack

First, let's settle on **all** libraries we will use for building the search UI. I haven't included **Astro** in this list because the search UI will be able to be consumed outside of an Astro project.

We will use [**Solid**](https://solidjs.com/) as our UI framework. I also recommend you to install the following [**Solid Primitives**](https://primitives.solidjs.community/), as they will greatly simplify the process: `refs`, `media`, `event-listener` and `utils`.

### Setting up

Now that we know our stack, let's install everything:

```bash
yarn astro add solid # Will add solid-js and @astrojs/solid-js
yarn add @solid-primitives/media @solid-primitives/refs @solid-primitives/event-listener @solid-primitives/utils
yarn add @vanilla-extract/css @vanilla-extract/recipes
yarn add -D @vanilla-extract/vite-plugin
```

### Getting started



{/* <Aside variant="tip">
  <>
    If you want to be able to pass props to the underlying component, you can make use of `splitProps`:

    ```tsx showLineNumbers=false
    const [localProps, otherProps] = splitProps(
      props,
      ["class", "children"],
    );
    ```
  </>
  <Button
    slot="action"
    variant="text"
    class="not-content"
    href="https://docs.solidjs.com/concepts/components/props/#splitprops"
    target="_blank">
      <ReadMoreIcon slot="leading" width={18} height={18} />
      <>Learn more</>
  </Button>
</Aside> */}

### Dialog

Most websites implement their search UI as a modal dialog. That's what we'll do now.



```tsx title="components/search/search.tsx"
type SearchProps = {
  children: JSX.Element;
}

export const Search: Component<SearchProps> = (props) => {
  /*
  We use a `<div>` instead of `<>` (fragment)
  because we dont' want our dialog to appear outside of `<astro-island>`.
  */
  return (
    <div>
      <dialog>

      </dialog>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Animation

You can skip this step if you don't wish to add animation to your dialog.



```bash
yarn add @solid-primitives/presence
```

```diff lang="tsx" title="components/search/search.tsx"
import { createPresence } from "@solid-primitives/presence";

export const Search: Component<SearchProps> = (props) => {
  const {
    isEntering,
    isExiting,
    isMounted
  } = createPresence({
    enterDuration: 600,
    exitDuration: 300,
  });

  const openView = (event?: MouseEvent) => {
    event?.preventDefault();
  }
  const closeView = () => {

  }

  createEffect<boolean>((prevMounted) => {
    document.body.toggleAttribute("data-dialog-open", open());
    if(isMounted() === prevMounted) return isMounted();
    if(isMounted()) {
      dialogRef.showModal();
    }
    else {
      dialogRef.close();
    }
    return isMounted();
  }, isMounted());

  return (
    <div>
      {anchor()}
      <dialog
        onClick={event => {
          const rect = event.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect();
          if (rect.left > event.clientX ||
              rect.right < event.clientX ||
              rect.top > event.clientY ||
              rect.bottom < event.clientY
          ) closeView();
        }}
        onCancel={closeView}>

      </dialog>
    </div>
  )
}
```
```diff lang="ts" title="components/search/search.css.ts"
-import { style } from "@vanilla-extract/css";
+import { style, keyframes } from "@vanilla-extract/css";
import { recipe } from "@vanilla-extract/recipes";

+const viewEnter = keyframes({
+  from: {
+    opacity: 0,
+    scale: 0.35,
+  },
+});
+const viewExit = keyframes({
+  to: {
+    opacity: 0,
+    scale: 0.35,
+  },
+});

-export const searchViewStyle = style({
+export const searchViewStyle = recipe({
+  base: {
// TODO: add base styles
+  },
+  variants: {
+    state: {
+      entering: {
+        animation: `${viewEnter} 600ms cubic-bezier(0.05, 0.7, 0.1, 1.0) forwards`,
+      },
+      exiting: {
+        animation: `${viewExit} 300ms 	cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.0, 0.8, 0.15) forwards`,
+      },
+    }
+  },
});
```

### Adding a responsive anchor

Now that our search UI is fully working, all that's left to do is to use it, right? Well, not quite. Remember how we must pass a search anchor to our component? Even though is anchor can be any clickable HTML element, I think it would be good for us to make a responsive search anchor.

We will have our component have 3 different states:
- Search icon button - **smallest**
- Search button with label - **medium**
- Search bar - **largest**

If you feel like the *medium* state is unnecessary, you can skip it, but I will show you how to make it just to demonstrate the use of adaptive breakpoints.

Since our UI design is based on [**Material You**](https://m3.material.io/), it's a good idea to keep the style consistent and use Material's official specifications for our anchor components:
- [Icon Buttons - **Filled tonal**](https://m3.material.io/components/icon-buttons/specs/#c2ca424b-2ad7-40e6-8946-47fb1918060a)
- [Common Buttons - **Filled tonal**](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/specs/#158f0a18-67fb-4ac4-9d22-cc4d1adc4579)
- [Search - **Search bar**](https://m3.material.io/components/search/specs/#2b4626d7-c5e6-4f2e-8f32-1a1643978512)

Here are the three components:

#### Search bar

```tsx title="components/search/search-bar.tsx"
import {} from "./search-bar.css";

export const SearchBar: Component = () => {
  return (

  );
}
```

```ts title="components/search/search-bar.css.ts"
```

#### Search icon

```tsx title="components/search/search-icon.tsx"
export const SearchIcon: Component = () => {
  return (

  );
}
```


Finally, it's time to unite all those 3 components into one. We'll call it `SearchAnchor`.

```tsx title="components/search/search-anchor.tsx"
import { type Component, type JSX, Switch, Match, createMemo } from "solid-js";
import { createMediaQuery } from "@solid-primitives/media";

import { SearchIcon } from "./search-icon";
import { SearchButton } from "./search-button";
import { SearchBar } from "./search-bar";

export type SearchAnchorProps = {
  variant?: "icon" | "button" | "bar";
}

type Breakpoint = "compact" | "medium" | "expanded";

export const SearchAnchor: Component<SearchAnchorProps> = (props) => {
  const createMinWidth = (value: number) =>
    createMediaQuery(`only screen and (min-width: ${value}px)`);

  const isMedium = createMinWidth(600);
  const isExpanded = createMinWidth(840);
  const breakpoint = createMemo<Breakpoint>(() => {
    if(isExpanded()) return "expanded";
    if(isMedium()) return "medium";
    return "compact";
  });

  return (
    <Switch>
      <Match when={breakpoint() === "compact"}>
        <SearchIcon />
      </Match>
      <Match when={breakpoint() === "medium"}>
        <SearchButton />
      </Match>
      <Match when={breakpoint() === "expanded"}>
        <SearchBar />
      </Match>
    </Switch>
  );
}
```

Let's update our `index.ts` file to export all new components:
```diff lang="ts" title="components/search/index.ts"
export * from "./search";
+export * from "./search-icon";
+export * from "./search-button";
+export * from "./search-bar";
+export * from "./search-anchor";
```



### Using the component

All that's left to do now is just to use our component. Let's add it to our `Header` component:

```diff lang="ts" title="components/Header.astro"
---
+import { Search, SearchAnchor } from "./search";

interface Props {}
---

<header>
+  <Search client:load>
+    <SearchAnchor />
+  </Search>
</header>
```

## Highlighting

Now that we have our search working, we can move on to add results highlighting!

```astro title="components/Highlight.astro"
---
import type { JSX } from "astro/jsx-runtime";

type Props = Omit<JSX.ScriptHTMLAttributes, "type" | "is:raw">;
---

<script is:inline type="module" {...Astro.props}> {/* Add `is:inline` here so the framework won't yell at us */}
  document.addEventListener(
    "astro:page-load",
    async () => {
      await import("/pagefind/pagefind-highlight.js");
      new PagefindHighlight({ highlightParam: "highlight" });
    }
  );
</script>
```

The Pagefind Highlighter will add the `pagefind-highlight` class to all highlighted elements, so we can style them appropriately.

Then, we just need to insert the `Highlight` component into our page's `head` element:
```diff lang="astro" title="layouts/Page.astro"
---
import Head from "../components/Head.astro";
+import Highlight from "../components/Highlight.astro";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <Head />
+    <Highlight />
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Styling

If you are not happy with the default highlight styles (which are quite nice!), you can give the highlight some shiny new styles.

<Aside variant="important">
  <>In order to style elements globally, we need to add an `is:global` attribute to our `<style>` element.</>
  <Button
    slot="action"
    variant="text"
    class="not-content"
    href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#global-styles"
    target="_blank">
      <ReadMoreIcon slot="leading" width={18} height={18} />
      <>Learn more</>
  </Button>
</Aside>

```diff lang="astro" title="layouts/Page.astro" collapse={1-13}
---
import Head from "../components/Head.astro";
import Highlight from "../components/Highlight.astro";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <Head />
    <Highlight />
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>

+<style is:global>
+  .pagefind-highlight { }
+</style>
```

Here's a basic example of custom highlight styles:

```css title="layouts/Page.astro" startLineNumber=17
.pagefind-highlight {

}
```

## Going further: automatic indexing

If you want to automatically run Pagefind after building your site, you could write a simple Astro integration.
First, we need to install `@types/node`:
```bash
yarn add -D @types/node
```

```ts title="integrations/pagefind.ts"
import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro";

export default function astroPagefind(): AstroIntegration {
  return {
    name: "astro-pagefind",
    hooks: {
      "astro:build:done": async ({ dir }) => {
          const targetDir = fileURLToPath(dir);
          const cwd = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
          const relativeDir = relative(cwd, targetDir);
          return new Promise<void>(resolve => {
            spawn(
              "yarn", ["dlx", "pagefind", "--site", relativeDir],
              {
                stdio: "inherit", // Needed so we can see the output of the command
                shell: true,
                cwd,
              }
            ).on("close", () => resolve());
          });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, add it to your Astro config:
```diff lang="ts" title="astro.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

import solidJs from "@astrojs/solid-js";
+import pagefind from "./src/integrations/pagefind";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    solidJs(),
+    pagefind(),
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

And that's it! Now Pagefind will run right after your site has been built. Try it out:

```bash
yarn build
```
../../components/primitives/button
