[**Astro**](https://astro.build/) is a framework for building blazingly fast statically generated sites. It is a great choice when building content-driven websites (this site is built with Astro!). But, when it comes to searching your site, there aren't many great picks except for [**Pagefind**](https://pagefind.app/), a full-text search library written in Rust which helps it reach outstanding performance.

Pagefind is really easy to integrate with *any* framework, because the only requirement is, well, static site generation! Just run the following command in your terminal (assuming that your generated site files reside in `./dist`):

```bash showLineNumbers=false
yarn dlx pagefind --site dist
```

The above command will generate a `pagefind` directory in our `dist` folder. This directory contains everything related to Pagefind: binaries (WASM), scripts (JS), indexes. It also contains Pagefind's modular UI library (`pagefind-modular-ui.js`), but we won't need that today. Only 2 files out of this whole directory are actually in our field of interest: `pagefind.js` and `pagefind-highlight.js`. The first one is the primary Pagefind library, which we'll need to implement searching, and the last one is the highlighting library used by Pagefind. For highlighting, skip to [**Highlighting**](#highlighting).

## Search UI

Now that we know the basics, it's time to create the search UI!

## Our stack

First, let's settle on **all** libraries we will use for building the search UI. I haven't included **Astro** in this list because the search UI will be able to be consumed outside of an Astro project.

We will use [**Solid**](https://solidjs.com/) as our UI framework. I also recommend you to install the following [**Solid Primitives**](https://primitives.solidjs.community/), as they will greatly simplify the process: `refs`, `media`, `event-listener` and `utils`.

### Setting up

Now that we know our stack, let's install everything:

```bash
yarn astro add solid # Will add solid-js and @astrojs/solid-js
yarn add @solid-primitives/media @solid-primitives/refs @solid-primitives/event-listener @solid-primitives/utils
yarn add @vanilla-extract/css @vanilla-extract/recipes
yarn add -D @vanilla-extract/vite-plugin
```

### Getting started



<Aside variant="tip">
  <>If you want to be able to pass props to the underlying component, you can make use of `splitProps`.</>
  <Button
    slot="action"
    variant="text"
    class="not-content"
    href="https://docs.solidjs.com/concepts/components/props/#splitprops"
    target="_blank">
      <ReadMoreIcon slot="leading" />
      <>Learn more</>
  </Button>

## Highlighting

Now that we have our search working, we can move on to add results highlighting!

```astro title="components/Highlight.astro"
---
import type { JSX } from "astro/jsx-runtime";

type Props = Omit<JSX.ScriptHTMLAttributes, "type" | "is:raw">;
---

<script is:inline type="module" {...Astro.props}> {/* Add `is:inline` here so the framework won't yell at us */}
  document.addEventListener(
    "astro:page-load",
    async () => {
      await import("/pagefind/pagefind-highlight.js");
      new PagefindHighlight({ highlightParam: "highlight" });
    }
  );
</script>
```

The Pagefind Highlighter will add the `pagefind-highlight` class to all highlighted elements, so we can style them appropriately.

Then, we just need to insert the `Highlight` component into our page's `head` element:
```diff lang="astro" title="layouts/Page.astro"
---
import Head from "../components/Head.astro";
+import Highlight from "../components/Highlight.astro";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <Head />
+    <Highlight />
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Styling

If you are not happy with the default highlight styles (which are quite nice!), you can give the highlight some shiny new styles.

<Aside variant="important">
  <>In order to style elements globally, we need to add an `is:global` attribute to our `<style>` element.</>
  <Button
    slot="action"
    variant="text"
    class="not-content"
    href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#global-styles"
    target="_blank">
      <ReadMoreIcon slot="leading" />
      <>Learn more</>
  </Button>
</Aside>

```diff lang="astro" title="layouts/Page.astro" collapse={1-13}
---
import Head from "../components/Head.astro";
import Highlight from "../components/Highlight.astro";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <Head />
    <Highlight />
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>

+<style is:global>
+  .pagefind-highlight { }
+</style>
```

Here's a basic example of custom highlight styles:

```css title="layouts/Page.astro" startLineNumber=17
.pagefind-highlight {

}
```

## Going further: automatic indexing

If you want to automatically run Pagefind after building your site, you could write a simple Astro integration.
First, we need to install `@types/node`:
```bash
yarn add -D @types/node
```

```ts title="integrations/pagefind.ts"
import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro";

export default function astroPagefind(): AstroIntegration {
  return {
    name: "astro-pagefind",
    hooks: {
      "astro:build:done": async ({ dir }) => {
          const targetDir = fileURLToPath(dir);
          const cwd = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
          const relativeDir = relative(cwd, targetDir);
          return new Promise<void>(resolve => {
            spawn(
              "yarn", ["dlx", "pagefind", "--site", relativeDir],
              {
                stdio: "inherit", // Needed so we can see the output of the command
                shell: true,
                cwd,
              }
            ).on("close", () => resolve());
          });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, add it to your Astro config:
```diff lang="ts" title="astro.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

import solidJs from "@astrojs/solid-js";
+import pagefind from "./src/integrations/pagefind";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    solidJs(),
+    pagefind(),
  ],
  /* ... */
});
```

And that's it! Now Pagefind will run right after your site has been built. Try it out:

```bash
yarn build
```
